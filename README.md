Code from my Masters of Astrophysics project: Simulating the Formation of Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters

The research presented has been spit into two sub projects:
- [Multiple Stellar Populations an Internal Kinematics](project_1) (MNRAS access [here](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/mnras/staa3376/5948118))
- [Metallicity Spreads and Anomolous Precursor Generations](project_2)

## Note to those assessing my masters dissertation:
Firstly, thank you for making it to the end pages of my thesis. I sincerly appreciate that you've taken the time to read my work, thank you. 

Supplementary material for my thesis include these animations I created:

Project 1:
- Animation 1: [Galaxy scale gas accretion](https://youtu.be/JXToXAeH33Q)
- Animation 2: [Cluster scale gas accretion](https://youtu.be/ZxYFJi5Y4eg)

Project 2:
- Animation 3: [Clump formation](https://youtu.be/Q-Sm4XARaq4)
