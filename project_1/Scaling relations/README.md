# Scaling relations

The outputs from the [centering_script](https://github.com/madeleine-mckenzie/mPhys/blob/main/project_1/jupyter_scripts/Centering_script.ipynb) compiled into tables which are imported into the script and are used to calculate the scaling relations.


Note: the observational line used to compare the data is from [Gratton et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26ARv..27....8G/abstract)
