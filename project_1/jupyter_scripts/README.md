# Jupyter scripts used for all the analysis

I have come to the conclusion that interactive notebooks are the fastest way to analyse these datasets. 
I should have probably turned these into proper scripts but I'm lazy and:
```
if !broken: 
  !fix
```

See the revisions file for the additional analysis and models run after the first round of revisions. This is where the animation code is hiding!
