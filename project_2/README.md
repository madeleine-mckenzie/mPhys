# Code from Project 2: Metallicity Spreads and Anomalous Precursor Populations

## File list:

### Analysis scripts
The tout.dat file has the same format as project 1 but now includes the masses (both gas and dust phase separately) for 11 elements included in the simulation. For this project all the analysis is done by jupyter scripts and the analysis file is only run to scale the values and output and save the python arrays

### jupyter_scripts
Analysis of all the files for project 2. This is where my clump finding algorithm is!
