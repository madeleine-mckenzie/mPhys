# Analysis files for the second part of the project

Similar to the analysis code in the previous project. In this one, no analysis is performed and it only uses tout.dat. It will perform all scaling and just output the numpy files. Scaling is different between the simulations. Further analysis is performed in the jupyter scripts.
