# JuPyter scripts for the second part of the project

## File description:

### 2_phase_2x3_plots
Makes the 6 panel time step plots

### 2_phase_new_disc

It was noticed that ram pressure impacts the gas component and it isnt centred on this disc and new stars. Therefore the analysis is re-performed for these components with different density cut off chrietera. It also outputs the 2x1 plot for the new and disc star components used in the paper.


### 2_phase_animation
Just like the animation file in the previous project, it makes a gif of the galaxy's evolution. 

### 2_phase_import3
The most important file!!
This includes 

### metallicity_plots
Creating the large metallicity plots of the eight largest clumps
